**Descrição do Problema**

**No artigo CORDIC: How Hand Calculators Calculate, o autor Alan Sultan apresenta a
família de algoritmos CORDIC (The College Mathematics Journal 40(2):87-92.March 2009 ):**

*Almost every calculus teacher I ask answers the question, “How do calculators compute sines
and cosines” with the words,“Taylor Polynomials.” It comes as quite a surprise to most that,
though it is reasonable to use Taylor polynomials, it is really a method known as CORDIC
that is used to compute these and other special functions. CORDIC was discovered by Jack
Volder in 1959 while working for the Convair corporation and was developed to replace the
analog resolver in the B-58 bomber’s navigation computer. What was needed was a program
that could compute trigonometric functions in real time without the use of much hardware.
CORDIC, an acronym for COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer, was the solution.
CORDIC is fast; much faster than Taylor series for the low level hardware used on a calcu-
lator, though when you first see it, it is hard to believe.*
